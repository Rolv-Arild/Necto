# Community Bot Beta Test

To download and help compute Necto the community bot, first make sure you have downloaded:
1. Rocket League
2. bakkesmod
3. python >=3.8
4. git


## To start computing

1. clone repo
2. start cmd as admin
3. create symlink to repo\training\training repo\training (mklink /D path\to\repo\training\training path\to\repo\training)
4. close cmd
6. open repo\training in windows explorer or non-admin cmd
7. Run runDistributedWorker.bat
8. enter your name + server ip + server password

when asked for the IP and password, dm Soren and he'll fill you in. 


## What is this?

This is Necto, the RLGym community bot. It's a bot that's learning to play 1's, 2's, and 3's thanks to RLGym.
Rocket League is a hard game though so we're all working together to give it the experience it needs.


## Can I watch it learn?

Yes! Check out our [Twitch stream here](https://www.twitch.tv/rlgym).
