# What is this?

This is Tecko, our community machine learning Rocket League bot. 
This is the 3rd generation of the bot and its learning to play 1's, 2's, and 3's thanks to RLGym.
Our end goal is making a version that can take down pros!

Fun fact, Tecko has the same number of neurons some real life geckos!

V1: Necto <br/>
V2: Nexto <br/>
V3: IN PROGRESS: Tecko <br/>
V4: IN PROGRESS: SSL/Pro Trained<br/>


[Watch Nexto V2 go up against RLCS Pros FairyPeak, Breezi, Aztral, Kaydop, and more on our YouTube channel!](https://www.youtube.com/c/RLGym/videos)

[SunlessKhan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owhz5RSX0go) and [Rocket Sledge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO4h8djNB50&t=387s)
have both made videos about Nexto!

# How does it work?

These bots are trained with [Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://wiki.pathmind.com/deep-reinforcement-learning), 
a type of Machine Learning. We have several games playing at super speeds behind the scenes while the data is collected and learned from.
We ingest these games using a custom built distributed learning system.

We define rewards that the bot tries to achieve. Over time, behavior that leads to more reward gets reinforced, which leads to 
better Rocket League play.

# Can I play against it? 

Yup! Go download the [RLBot pack](https://rlbot.org/) and Nexto and Necto are some of the bots that you can play against.
 Make sure fps is set to 120 and VSync is turned off.


# What Rocket League rank is the bot?

Tecko is still being trained so we don't yet know.

Nexto is low-mid Grand Champion, depending on the version

Necto is around high Diamond. 



# Can I watch it learn?

Check out our [Twitch stream here](https://www.twitch.tv/rlgym).

[Graphs are also available](https://wandb.ai/rolv-arild/rocket-learn) for our fellow nerds.


# Could it learn by looking at Pro/SSL replays?

Yes! The recent breakthrough in [Video PreTraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11795) has allowed us start building a model that's seen years of gameplay before
setting a wheel on the field. Occasionally, we showcase its progress on our Twitch stream. In the future, we plan to follow up this "jumpstarted" training with live reinforcement learning.

[Here's an explanation of how it all works.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oz5yZc9ULAc)


# Could it learn by playing against me?

We're working on it! 


# Can I donate my compute to help it learn faster?

We're currently not accepting compute donations but thanks for your interest!


# What is Nexto++?

Nexto++ is a secret post-training upgrade to Nexto that increases its already impressive skill. It is not available for play but may make appearances in future RLBot tournaments.


# What is Toxic Nexto?

Toxic Nexto is a version of Nexto at the same skill level but provides that authentic Rocket League experience of harsh words and bad vibes. It's equally mean to its opponents as to its teammates.

It can be played against in the RLBot pack.
